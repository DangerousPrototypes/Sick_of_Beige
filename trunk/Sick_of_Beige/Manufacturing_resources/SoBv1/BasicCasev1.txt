Sick of Beige basic case v1 (DP6037)

A clear laser-cut acrylic project case kit. Protect your project from electrical shorts and fingers, but keep it accessible for hacking and showing off. Sick of Beige basic case v1 is designed to be simple, cheap, and easy to assemble. The project PCB is sandwiched between two laser cut acrylic sheets, and the whole assembly is held together with aluminum screws and standoffs.

Sick of Beige PCB templates and clear enclosures make it super easy to design your project for a case. Drop a standard PCB footprint on your schematic, and then route on the board template. The board shape, size, limitations, and many connector placements are already taken care of. 

This is a test batch of cases for DP6037 (60mmx37mm PCB size) compatible boards.
